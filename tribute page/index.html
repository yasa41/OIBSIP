        Tony Stark, the genius billionaire, redefined technology and innovation.
        As the heir to Stark Industries, his groundbreaking work in clean
        energy, artificial intelligence, and defense systems shaped the future.

        His transformation into Iron Man symbolized not just engineering
        brilliance but also responsibility. From building the first Arc
        Reactor-powered suit in captivity to developing cutting-edge AI and
        global defense systems, his legacy is one of relentless innovation and
        vision.
